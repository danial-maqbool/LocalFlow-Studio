### Commands and evidence interpretation

Run in the repository root. Replace `<new-dir>` with a new ignored run directory. Preserve all failed evidence.

```powershell
py -3 bootstrap.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/preflight.py --report-dir <new-dir>
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip check
.\start.bat --demo --no-browser --port 0
py -3 bootstrap.py --dev
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/preflight.py --tests --require-native --report-dir <new-dir>
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip freeze
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/verify.py --strict --report-dir <new-dir>
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/browser_check.py --slow-api --record --report-dir <new-dir>

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/browser_interaction_check.py --report-dir <new-dir>
```

Command JSON beside logs records exact arguments, exit codes, start times and durations. Preflight, suite, browser and worker reports use separate directories. Late `runtime/` reruns outside LocalFlow occurred after development installation; the initial `runtime-early/` evidence is the valid runtime-only proof.

Browser evidence covers light/dark themes, narrow/wide layouts, navigation, visible keyboard focus, real downloads and parsed bytes. All acceptance uses direct loopback navigation. Interaction checks invoke the real UI job module and backend; they do not prove every physical keyboard/device or OS adapter.

The bounded sample took 1.716 seconds, with 33030144 bytes peak working set in the actual in-process Python test interpreter. This includes test imports and excludes native child workers and interpreter startup. It is not a whole-application benchmark. See `performance-02/performance.json`. The earlier `performance/` measured the Windows venv launcher and is not a valid application-memory measurement.

### Offline evidence

Setup downloads preceded isolation. An unprivileged Linux container used Docker `--network none`, read-only source and a writable synthetic evidence mount, with bounded CPU/memory/process limits. A reserved-address probe failed with ENETUNREACH. `strace -f` observed backend tests and browser/backend processes. Backend destinations were loopback only. Chromium DNS attempts to the container resolver failed with ENETUNREACH. No successful outbound runtime connection was observed. Browser-only assertions were not used as backend proof. No host firewall change or neural model download.

The first container attempt lacked a named account/home for its numeric UID and browser profile. Those environment failures remain in `offline-01/`. The corrected image has a real unprivileged user/home. Container success is not Windows native-session acceptance.

## Defects and regression tests

1. Windows checkout line endings caused false source-manifest failures. `scripts/materialize.py` now canonicalizes CRLF only for recognized text without NUL bytes. Binary hashes remain exact. Two `tests/test_manifest.py` regressions cover text and binary content. The text regression failed before the fix and passed after it. Manifest hashes were refreshed after source review.
2. The browser checker could inspect state before a pending POST finished. API-request tracking and a quiet interval now gate assertions. Real delayed-API browser runs retain feature assertions. Saved downloads are compared with authenticated backend bytes and parsed. An initial attachment-response-body comparison was a harness error; that failed evidence remains.
3. Project-local acceptance and interaction scripts retain fixtures, outputs and hashes. Vendored localdesk copies were compared; no shared runtime module or project-specific runtime behavior was replaced.

## Skips and blocked checks

- `tests.test_safety.SafetyTests.test_symlink_input_is_rejected`: This OS account cannot create symbolic links.
- `tests.test_vault.VaultTests.test_ciphertext_file_permissions`: POSIX mode test.
- `tests.test_vault.VaultTests.test_vault_symlink_is_rejected`: Creating symbolic links may need a Windows developer setting.

Native login tasks, OS keyring persistence and title/input adapters were not exercised in the active profile. Unit/mock adapter checks are not native acceptance. Optional neural models were NOT RUN by design; automatic downloads were prohibited and the built-in statistical backend was tested.

## Source and output safety

Only synthetic documents and browser databases were used. Origins, initial commits and clean status were recorded. Acceptance fixtures and outputs have hashes; browser download evidence records saved byte hashes. Historical release reports, screenshots and GIFs were preserved. Vaults, passphrases, exports, caches, raw logs and private absolute paths are not committed.

Only owned launchers, backends, browser contexts, containers and Office instances were stopped. No personal Office document or browser history was read. No login service or saved OS credential was created. Existing Tesseract was added to user PATH with the previous value retained locally; new terminals inherit it. No machine-wide PATH or global firewall/security setting was changed.

README commands and relative documentation links were checked: no broken local targets or README em dashes. Each app remains independently installable. Staged changes were checked for secrets/private paths before normal branch pushes. GitHub CI is separate evidence; the five-project summary records exact pushed heads and checks.

## User actions

1. Provide a disposable Windows profile/session with permission to create symbolic links, then rerun both skipped symlink tests and the strict suite there. No global security setting was changed.
2. In an isolated Windows session, install the documented login service, close the terminal, log out/in, create a synthetic watched file, verify output, pause/restart, uninstall and verify test-created credentials are removed. Enter any synthetic passphrase locally, never in chat.
3. Give explicit local consent inside that disposable desktop for synthetic input or window-title capture; test focus/exclusion, pause, exit, restart and confirmation rules there.

## Source CI

PASS: [Tests workflow](https://github.com/danial-maqbool/LocalFlow-Studio/actions/runs/34131855495) at `d2a57a348336098589b71eef098ce7ffb3e14875`. This is remote CI, separate from local acceptance.

## Decision

PARTIAL. No claim that all applicable Windows acceptance gates passed. Automated and browser successes do not remove native-session blockers.
